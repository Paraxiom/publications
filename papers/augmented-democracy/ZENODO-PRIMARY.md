## Description (copy this exactly)

This work defines a procedural, coherence-constrained governance framework that treats democratic legitimacy as a measurable property of process quality—independent of specific outcomes or semantic truth arbitration.

The framework introduces:
- **Admissible fact artifacts**: Evidence constrained by provenance, not correctness
- **Engagement verification gates**: Participation requires demonstrated engagement with relevant materials
- **Bounded influence**: Quadratic voting costs and credential decay prevent plutocratic capture
- **Coherence thresholds**: Statistical independence metrics (γ) detect coordination, Sybil attacks, and bribery

The central claim is architectural: governance can be modeled as a control system with formal invariants, rollback semantics, and failure detection under adversarial conditions.

This work makes no claims of immediate deployment, productization, or political adoption. The contribution is systems-theoretic. Blockchain and quantum components referenced in the text are execution substrates, not the contribution itself.
