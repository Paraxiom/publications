## Description (copy this exactly)

Technical appendices accompanying "Augmented Democracy as a Coherence-Constrained Control System."

This document provides:
- **Appendix A**: Formal mathematical definitions (participant space, proposal space, admissible artifacts, credential functions, coherence score)
- **Appendix B**: Protocol mechanics (credential decay, voting protocol, proposal lifecycle, epoch parameters)
- **Appendix C**: Security analysis (threat model, Sybil resistance proofs, bribery cost bounds, coordination detection)
- **Appendix D**: Reference implementation (Substrate pallets, Solidity interfaces, oracle integration patterns)
- **Appendix E**: Deployment checklist and monitoring guidance

These appendices are intended for implementers, auditors, and researchers requiring full technical depth beyond the main paper.
