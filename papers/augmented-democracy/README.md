## What This Is

A procedural, coherence-constrained governance framework that treats democratic legitimacy as a measurable property of process quality—independent of specific outcomes.

The contribution is architectural and systems-theoretic:
- Governance modeled as a control system with formal invariants
- Proposals as state transitions with rollback semantics
- Coherence (γ) as a Lyapunov-like stability metric
- Failure detection under adversarial conditions

---

## What This Is Not

This is **not**:
- A software product
- A DAO
- A blockchain protocol
- A governance token
- A political platform or ideology

The work defines infrastructure logic. It does not prescribe outcomes.
