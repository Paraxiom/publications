## What Has Been Built (Last 6 Months)

| Product | Description | Tests Passing |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| **QuantumHarmony** | Post-quantum Layer 1 blockchain — LIVE, 3 validators | 950 |
| **QSSH** | Post-quantum SSH replacement (Falcon/SPHINCS+/ML-KEM) | 124 |
| **QSSL** | Patent-free post-quantum TLS | 40 |
| **Drista** | PQ encrypted chat with zero-knowledge proofs | 76 |
| **Coherence Shield** | Responsible AI proxy — deployed, blockchain-attested | 35 |
| **TAO Signal** | B2B signal API with X402 micropayments | 2 |
| **QuantumTimeSandwich** | Quantum spectral simulation engine | 241 |

**Total: 7 production systems. 1,468 passing tests.**

## Formal Verification (Our Competitive Moat)

| Verification Level | Tool | Count |
|-------------------|------|-------|
| Panic-freedom | Kani (AWS) | 102 harnesses |
| Functional correctness | Verus (Microsoft Research) | 49 proofs |
| **Mathematical foundations** | **Lean 4 + Mathlib** | **549 theorems** |

No other company in the post-quantum space has this. Not PQShield. Not SandboxAQ. Not IBM.

549 machine-checked mathematical proofs, all publicly auditable. Zero assumptions. Zero shortcuts.

---

## Research Output

- **16 Zenodo publications** with DOIs (citable prior art)
- **Toroidal Logit Bias**: Original ML research, +2.8pp TruthfulQA improvement
- **Defensive Technical Disclosure**: 4 embodiments — blocks competitor patents at $0 cost
- **HuggingFace Space**: Live demo of toroidal logit bias

## Market Replacement Cost

What it would cost a company to hire a team to build what I built:

| Role Required | Annual Rate (Fully Loaded) |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| Senior Blockchain Engineer | $250,000 – $350,000 |
| Post-Quantum Cryptography Engineer | $250,000 – $350,000 |
| Formal Verification Specialist (Lean 4) | $300,000 – $400,000 |
| Backend / API Engineer | $180,000 – $250,000 |
| DevOps / Infrastructure | $180,000 – $250,000 |
| Research Scientist | $200,000 – $300,000 |

**That's 5–6 senior engineers working full-time for 6 months.**

### By Deliverable

| Deliverable | Market Cost |
|-------------|------------|
| Custom L1 blockchain (live, 950 tests) | $1,500,000 – $2,500,000 |
| 3 PQ protocol implementations (QSSH + QSSL + Drista) | $1,000,000 – $2,000,000 |
| 549 Lean 4 formal proofs (consulting rate: $300–500/hr) | $500,000 – $1,000,000 |
| Coherence Shield + TAO Signal | $500,000 – $1,000,000 |
| 16 research publications | $200,000 – $400,000 |
| Infrastructure (4 servers, live validators) | $100,000 – $200,000 |

### Total Engineering Value

| Rate Basis | Estimated Value |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Mid-market rates** | **$4,000,000 – $6,000,000** |
| **Bay Area / top-tier rates** | **$8,000,000 – $10,000,000** |

---

## Effective Hourly Rate

6 months = ~1,040 working hours.

| Basis | Rate |
|-------|------|
| At $4M value | **$3,846 / hour** |
| At $6M value | **$5,769 / hour** |
| At $8M value | **$7,692 / hour** |

This is the engineering output that underpins every sales conversation, every investor pitch, and every enterprise demo.

## What This Means for Sales

When you're in front of a client or investor, here's what you can say:

> "Paraxiom has 7 production post-quantum systems backed by 549 mathematical proofs — more formal verification than any other company in the PQC space. Our protocol suite is patent-free, open source, and ready for enterprise deployment. The NIST 2035 deadline means every regulated organization needs what we've already built."

### Key Differentiators for Sales Conversations

1. **Patent-free** — No licensing fees. No procurement friction. Government-friendly.
2. **Formally verified** — 549 Lean 4 proofs. Auditable by anyone. No trust required.
3. **Already built** — Not a roadmap. Not a whitepaper. 7 working systems, 1,468 tests.
4. **Canadian** — Montreal-based. IRAP-eligible. Canadian data sovereignty.
5. **Open source** — Customers can audit everything. Transparency is the product.

## Next Steps

1. **Upload investor deck to Alice** — paraxiom.org/investor-deck.html
2. **IRAP application** — this week (non-dilutive, up to $500K)
3. **Quantonation pitch** — this month (quantum-focused VC, Paris)
4. **Enterprise outreach** — Desjardins, SITA, CCCS (Daryl to lead)
5. **NIST case study submission** — gets us on every CISO's radar
