Looking for QKD / QRNG infrastructure holders for protocol-level experimentation
I'm working on a lightweight consensus mechanism that consumes measured QKD channel quality / QRNG entropy as an input signal (not key transport).
I'm looking to connect with organizations or labs that operate:
• fiber-based QKD links
• satellite QKD testbeds
• certified QRNG devices
Scope is exploratory and implementation-focused (testnet / lab environment).
Happy to share technical details privately with interested operators.
